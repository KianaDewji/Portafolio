		<h1><strong>HEYSIL BAEZ <3</strong></h1>

		<p>(noun): An individual that is very weird, laughs a lot, and is sleeping 3/4 of the day.</p>
		<h2 class="halo">MY BACKGROUND...</h2>
		<p>I was born in the Dominican Republic in 2001 and lived there until december of 2011. I left because there was no economic stability
		and the crime rates were only increasing. I have a little sister named Sheysil who just turned 10 last week. I also have a half brother
		named Oneal who is 23. My family and I are really goofy, we love messing around with each other. </p>
		<p> My name came to be in a very interesting way. My mom, Heydi, took her first three letters and my dad, silfrido, took his first three
			letters and combined both of those to make <strong> HEYSIL </strong></p>
		<h2 class="halo">I LOVE... </h2>
